# Module 3: Password Generator
Build a password generator for employees

## Description

This project was intended to build a tool for employees that needed to generate a secure password. 

It allows employees to randomly generate a password of between 8 and 128 characters that can include: upper case letters, lower case letters, special characters and numbers. 

It solves the employees having to think about the password themselves and reduces the risk of an employee choosing an easily guessable password (their maiden name, first street, pet's name etc.)
